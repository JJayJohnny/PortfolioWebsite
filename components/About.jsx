                        I&apos;ve always been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. It all started with playing games and later evolved into an interest in how they actually work, what new things are being developed and a desire to program them myself.

                        That's why I've decided to study <b className="text-green-600">Informatics</b> at <b className="text-green-600">GdaÅ„sk University of Technology</b>, where I live. I've obtained an <b className="text-green-600">Engineering degree</b> with honors (GPA 4.58 ðŸ¤“), and I am currently pursuing a <b className="text-green-600">Master of Engineering degree</b> in the same field. My specialty of choice is <b className="text-green-600">High-Performance Computing and Computational Intelligence</b>. Overall, I feel that these studies have given me a solid foundation for future work in software development, regardless of the career path I choose. I've learned many things that will be valuable in my professional life and have also developed important soft skills.

                        I've gained my first experience in the IT sector during my internship at <b className="text-green-600">Intel</b>, where I worked as a <b className="text-green-600">Graphics Software Development Intern</b> in the PreSi CI Team. I've learned a lot about test automation, CI/CD processes, industry-standard tools, and the importance of teamwork. I've also had the opportunity to work on a real project with people from different countries, which was a great experience.

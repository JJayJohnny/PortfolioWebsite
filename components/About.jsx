                        I've always been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. It all started with playing games and later evolved into an interest in how they actually work, what new things are being developed and a desire to program them myself.

                    <p>
                        That's why I've decided to study <b className=" text-green-600">computer science</b> at <b className=" text-green-600">GdaÅ„sk University of Technology</b> where I live. I'm currently on the <b className="text-green-600">5th semester</b>, getting really good grades (GPA 4.43ðŸ¤“), and I'm extremely pleased with my choice of degree. I feel that I have learned a lot of things that will be valuable in my future professional life and have also developed important soft skills.
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>
                        I wish to gain my first experience in the IT sector, learn the process of software development and work as part of a team on a big project.
